# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting cardiovascular disease using machine learning techniques. The dataset undergoes preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training with various algorithms. Techniques such as SMOTE for handling class imbalance and hyperparameter tuning are applied to enhance model performance.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Building:** Training different machine learning models to predict cardiovascular disease.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model parameters to improve accuracy and robustness.
- **Boosting Algorithms:** Implementing advanced techniques like XGBoost and LightGBM.
- **SMOTE:** Addressing class imbalance by generating synthetic data.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed and install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the pipeline:
```bash
jupyter notebook "Cardiovascular_Disease Prediction.ipynb"
```

## File Structure
- `Cardiovascular_Disease Prediction.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the full workflow.
- `data/` - Directory containing dataset files (if applicable).
- `models/` - Directory where trained models are stored.
- `requirements.txt` - List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Results
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Identifies key features contributing to cardiovascular disease.
